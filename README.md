## Quick

The code below executes a **blocking** `POST` against `http://httpize.herokuapp.com/post` with request headers `Accept: application/json, text/html, text/plain`,  `Cache-Control: no-cache` and `Content-Type: text/plain`, and request entity `some very important message`. It expects a `200` with some response body. If it encounters an exception or another status code then they are returned too. The type returned is `\/[String, String]`: left `String` (`-\/[String]`) indicates the error, and the right `String` (`\/-[String]`)  contains the successful response body.


```scala
import org.purang.net.http._
import scalaz._, Scalaz._
import org.purang.net.http.ning.DefaultAsyncHttpClientNonBlockingExecutor
import org.asynchttpclient.DefaultAsyncHttpClientConfig

implicit val sse = java.util.concurrent.Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2)
val config = new DefaultAsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder()
  .setCompressionEnforced(true)
  .setConnectTimeout(500)
  .setRequestTimeout(3000)
  .build()
implicit val newExecutor = DefaultAsyncHttpClientNonBlockingExecutor(config)

val response = (POST >
   "http://httpize.herokuapp.com/post" >>
   ("Accept" `:` "application/json" ++ "text/html" ++ "text/plain") ++
   ("Cache-Control" `:` "no-cache") ++
   ("Content-Type" `:` "text/plain") >>>
   "some very important message").~>(
     (x: ExecutedRequest) => x.fold(
        t => t._1.getMessage.left,
        {
          case (200, _, Some(body), _) => body.right
          case (status: Status, headers: Headers, body: Body, req: Request) => status.toString.left
        }
      ))


// close the client
// newExecutor.close()
// sse.shutdownNow()
```

For examples of **non blocking/ asynchronous calls** look at  [src/test/scala/NonBlockingExecutorSpec.scala](https://github.com/ppurang/asynch/blob/master/src/test/scala/NonBlockingExecutorSpec.scala)

For examples of **blocking calls** look at  [src/test/scala/ExecutorSpec.scala](https://github.com/ppurang/asynch/blob/master/src/test/scala/ExecutorSpec.scala)

For an example of a **custom configured executor** look at [src/test/scala/CustomNingExecutorSpec.scala](https://github.com/ppurang/asynch/blob/master/src/test/scala/CustomNingExecutorSpec.scala). Here is the meat of the code:


```scala
implicit val sse = java.util.concurrent.Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2)
val config = new DefaultAsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder()
  .setCompressionEnforced(true)
  .setConnectTimeout(500)
  .setRequestTimeout(3000)
  .build()
implicit val newExecutor = DefaultAsyncHttpClientNonBlockingExecutor(config)
```

## Types


```scala
type FailedRequest =  (Throwable, Request)

type AResponse = (Status, Headers, Body, Request)

type or[+E, +A] = \/[E, A]

type ExecutedRequest = FailedRequest or AResponse

type NonBlockingExecutedRequest = scalaz.concurrent.Task[AResponse]

trait NonBlockingExecutor extends (Timeout => Request => NonBlockingExecutedRequest)

type ExecutedRequestHandler[T] = (ExecutedRequest => T)
```

## Testing support? Easy.

Here is an example of test executor [src/test/scala/TestExecutor.scala](https://github.com/ppurang/asynch/blob/master/src/test/scala/TestExecutor.scala)
 that looks up things in a Map used internally to test things.


## Philosophy

0. Timeouts - Yes! we do timeouts.
1. Immutable - API to assemble requests and response handling is immutable.
2. Easy parts are easy (if you can look beyond weird operators and operator precedence). For example a request is easy to assemble
`GET > "http://www.google.com"` actually even the `GET` isn't really needed either `("http://www.host.com" >> Accept(ApplicationJson))`.
3. Full control -  you are forced to deal with the exceptions and responses. You even have the request that got executed if you wanted to modify it to re-execute.
4. Parts are done with scalaz goodness.


## Limitations

0. Too many implicits!
1. Entity bodies can only be strings or types that can implictly be converted to strings. No endless Streams.
2. No explicit Authentication support.
3. No web socket or such support.
4. Underlying http call infrastructure is as asynchronous, fast, bug-free as async-http-client.
5. No metrics and no circuit breakers.
